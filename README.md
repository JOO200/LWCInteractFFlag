# LWCInteractFlag
Flag for WorldGuard in combination with LWC


# Usage
`/rg flag <rg-id> lwc-interact allow|deny|none`
If set to allow, all public locked doors, chests etc. are accessable regardless to worldguard settings.
E.g: Player has no rights in a certain area, but the chest is locked with /cpublic and the lwc-interact flag is set to allow, then the player can open the chest.
